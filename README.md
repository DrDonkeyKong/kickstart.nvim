# kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Single-file
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

---

## This fork: personal setup notes

This fork of kickstart is shared between two machines:

- **Ubuntu 24.04 laptop** (native Linux) — this is the **leading** setup. All
  decisions are made for it first.
- **Windows laptop with WSL2** (Ubuntu inside WSL) — expected to follow the
  Ubuntu setup. The config lives inside the WSL filesystem, not on the Windows
  side. Neovim runs inside WSL; GUI apps like `zathura` are shown via WSLg.
  If a change might need extra attention on the WSL machine, the user should
  be notified so that machine can be adjusted — but the Ubuntu setup is not
  constrained to make WSL easier.

The config itself is intentionally identical on both hosts. Host-specific
overrides belong in `lua/local.lua` (gitignored, sourced at the end of
`init.lua`), never in the tracked files.

### Neovim installation (both machines, as of 2026)

Both machines run Neovim from the **upstream release tarball**, extracted under
`~/.local/share/nvim-linux-x86_64/` and symlinked into `~/.local/bin/nvim`
(which must precede `/usr/bin` on `PATH`). This is currently the only sane
option on Ubuntu 24.04, because:

- The Ubuntu archive ships Neovim 0.9.5, too old for VimTeX master (needs
  >= 0.11, and this config targets 0.12.4).
- `ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable` is abandoned — last publish 2026-01-11, still on a
  pre-0.12.0 dev snapshot.
- `ppa:neovim-ppa/stable` is also abandoned — no activity for well over a year,
  and it does not ship a `neovim` package for Noble (24.04) at all; the newest
  `neovim` source in it is `0.7.2` for Jammy from 2022-07.
- Snap/Flatpak Neovim have sandbox friction with Mason-installed LSPs and
  clipboard, so they are avoided.

Concrete steps and the LaTeX toolchain install are documented in
`~/Downloads/nvim-latex-laptop-setup.md` on the laptop (and the equivalent
setup was performed on the WSL machine).

### Updating Neovim

There is no auto-update. To move to a newer release:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -fLO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C ~/.local/share
# symlink already points into the extracted tree; usually no re-link needed
nvim --version | head -1
```

The tarball extracts over the existing directory in place. Plugin state under
`~/.local/share/nvim/` (different directory) is untouched.

### Note to any future agent working on this setup

> **Do not treat the current install method as fixed.** The tarball approach was
> chosen because, at the time this README was written, every apt-based path on
> Ubuntu 24.04 was either too old or unmaintained, and version managers were
> considered overkill for two machines. If you are reading this later:
>
> - Re-check the state of `ppa:neovim-ppa/{stable,unstable}` and any successor
>   PPA. If a maintained apt source has appeared that ships a current Neovim
>   for the host's Ubuntu release, it is likely the better default.
> - Re-check whether the Ubuntu archive itself has caught up (a newer LTS or an
>   HWE-style backport may have landed a modern Neovim).
> - `bob` (Rust-based Neovim version manager) is a reasonable managed
>   alternative if manual updates ever become annoying; the tradeoff is that it
>   should be adopted on **both** machines at once to keep the setup uniform.
> - **The Ubuntu laptop is the leading setup.** All decisions are made for
>   Ubuntu first; the WSL2 machine is expected to follow. Do **not** constrain
>   the Ubuntu setup to accommodate WSL quirks. If a change is likely to need
>   extra care on the WSL side (e.g. WSLg / zathura / clipboard / SyncTeX
>   behaviour, path translation, systemd-in-WSL assumptions), **flag it to the
>   user** so the WSL machine can be adjusted separately — do not water down
>   the Ubuntu setup to avoid the flag.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have at least the latest
stable version. Most likely, you want to install neovim via a [package
manager](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-package).
To check your neovim version, run `nvim --version` and make sure it is not
below the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) version. If
your chosen install method only gives you an outdated version of neovim, find
alternative [installation methods below](#alternative-neovim-installation-methods).

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation),
  [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- [tree-sitter CLI](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/crates/cli/README.md#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

### Install Kickstart

> [!NOTE]
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%localappdata%\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> [!NOTE]
> Your fork's URL will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart.nvim.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `nvim-lua` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

#### Read The Friendly Documentation

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about a particular plugin check its repository's documentation.


### Getting Started

[The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim](https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o)

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing Neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information
* Why is the kickstart `init.lua` a single file? Wouldn't it make sense to split it into multiple files?
  * The main purpose of kickstart is to serve as a teaching tool and a reference
    configuration that someone can easily use to `git clone` as a basis for their own.
    As you progress in learning Neovim and Lua, you might consider splitting `init.lua`
    into smaller parts. A fork of kickstart that does this while maintaining the
    same functionality is available here:
    * [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
  * Discussions on this topic can be found here:
    * [Restructure the configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/218)
    * [Reorganize init.lua into a multi-file setup](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/pull/473)

### Install Recipes

Below you can find OS specific install instructions for Neovim and dependencies.

After installing all the dependencies continue with the [Install Kickstart](#install-kickstart) step.

#### Windows Installation

<details><summary>Windows with Microsoft C++ Build Tools and CMake</summary>
Installation may require installing build tools and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
</details>
<details><summary>Windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>
Alternatively, one can install gcc and make which don't require changing the config,
the easiest way is to use choco:

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
run in cmd as **admin**:
```
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. install all requirements using choco, exit the previous cmd and
open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:
```
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make tree-sitter
```

### Alternative neovim installation methods

For some systems it is not unexpected that the [package manager installation
method](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-package)
recommended by neovim is significantly behind. If that is the case for you,
pick one of the following methods that are known to deliver fresh neovim versions very quickly.
They have been picked for their popularity and because they make installing and updating
neovim to the latest versions easy. You can also find more detail about the
available methods being discussed
[here](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/1583).
